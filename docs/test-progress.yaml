path_handling:
  status: in_progress
  findings:
    - The path handling test is failing because media files aren't being copied correctly
    - The test setup is correct, with proper vault and Jekyll paths
    - The MediaHandler correctly converts Unicode filenames (über.jpg -> uber.jpg)
    - The issue is in the process_image method not actually saving the files
    
  reflections:
    - We've been focusing too much on configuration and paths, when the real issue is simpler
    - The test output shows that target paths are correct but files don't exist
    - We need to verify that process_image is actually saving files
    - We should add more granular tests for each MediaHandler method
    
  next_steps:
    - Add unit tests for MediaHandler.process_image
    - Add unit tests for MediaHandler.sync_media
    - Add logging to track file operations
    - Consider using atomic operations for image processing
    
  test_coverage:
    - Complex filenames: ✓ (test exists but failing)
    - Unicode characters: ✓ (test exists but failing)
    - Special characters: ✓ (test exists but failing)
    - Long filenames: ✓ (test exists but failing)
    - Atomic operations: ✗ (needs tests)
    - Error handling: ✗ (needs tests)
    
  bugs_found:
    - process_image not saving files correctly
    - Multiple mkdir calls in sync_media (redundant)
    - No atomic operations for image processing
    - No error handling for failed file operations
