# Implementation Checklist

> **Strategy**: Based on [Sync Strategy](../sync-strategy.md)  
> **Tasks**: Detailed in [Core Tasks](core-tasks.md)  
> **Status**: ✅ All core functionality complete

## File Structure ✅
- [x] All content under /atomics/YYYY/MM/DD/
  - [x] No special folders for posts/drafts in Obsidian
  - [x] Images live in same daily folder as their posts
  - [x] Posts identified by frontmatter status, not location
  - [x] Preserve original file locations

## Post Detection & Processing ✅
- [x] Detect posts by frontmatter status="published"
  - [x] Recursively scan entire atomics directory
  - [x] Ignore files without status
  - [x] Handle drafts correctly
- [x] Extract date from folder path (YYYY/MM/DD)
- [x] Keep original Obsidian filenames
- [x] Create Jekyll filenames with date prefix

## Media Handling ✅
- [x] Keep images with their posts in daily folders
- [x] Use absolute vault paths in Obsidian (![[atomics/YYYY/MM/DD/image.png]])
- [x] Convert to Jekyll web paths (/assets/img/posts/image.png)
- [x] Only sync media referenced by posts
- [x] Clean up unused media in Jekyll
  - [x] Configurable cleanup timing
  - [x] Safe cleanup with file checks
  - [x] Proper binary file handling
- [x] Image optimization and resizing
- [x] Handle complex filenames and paths
- [x] Robust error handling
  - [x] File operation errors
  - [x] Permission issues
  - [x] Binary file handling
- [x] Detailed operation logging
  - [x] File operation tracking
  - [x] Error reporting
  - [x] Debug logging

## Sync Logic ✅
- [x] Bidirectional sync
  - [x] Obsidian → Jekyll: Update content and convert paths
  - [x] Jekyll → Obsidian: Update only content, preserve paths
- [x] Never move files in Obsidian
- [x] Preserve Obsidian frontmatter structure
- [x] Use file timestamps for conflict resolution
- [x] Atomic operations with rollback
- [x] Batch processing support
