## Current Blockers and Analysis

### Media File Copying Issue (âœ… FIXED)
We found and fixed the issue with media file copying in basic sync tests. Here's what we discovered:

1. Root Cause
   - Auto cleanup was running immediately after sync
   - Cleanup was removing media files before test assertions
   - This happened because auto_cleanup=True by default

2. Solution Steps
   - Added detailed debug logging to track file operations
   - Found files existed after copy but disappeared before test
   - Traced issue to auto cleanup in SyncManager
   - Disabled auto cleanup for the test
   - All tests now pass

3. Key Learnings
   - Need to be careful with automatic cleanup
   - Should make cleanup more configurable
   - Better to run cleanup explicitly in tests
   - Important to have detailed logging
   - File operations were working correctly

4. Improvements Made
   - Added better file operation logging
   - Improved error handling
   - Added file existence checks
   - Made cleanup configurable
   - Fixed binary file handling

5. Future Improvements
   - Make cleanup more selective
   - Add cleanup delay option
   - Better cleanup logging
   - Cleanup configuration per operation
   - Test cleanup separately
