# Test Progress

## Current Status

### Core Tests
1. Core Components
   - Atomic Operations: All tests passing
   - Change Detection: All tests passing
   - Config Handling: All tests passing

2. Media Tests
   - Processing: All tests passing
   - Sync: Tests failing due to path handling
   - References: Tests failing due to path handling
   - Performance: Tests failing due to path handling

3. Sync Tests
   - Basic: Tests failing due to path handling
   - Errors: Tests failing due to path handling
   - Cleanup: All tests passing
   - Media: Tests failing due to path handling
   - Paths: Tests failing due to path handling
   - Performance: Tests failing due to count mismatch

4. Handler Tests
   - Post: All tests passing

## Test Coverage Goals
- Core Components: 90%
- Handlers: 85%
- Integration Tests: 80%

## Notes
- Keep test names consistent with documentation
- Add more debug logging for failing tests
- Consider adding transaction rollback for failed operations
- Document any config changes in guides
- Remember lessons from auto cleanup issues
- Keep YAML parsing fixes in mind for new tests
- Consider adding test categories to test names for better organization

## Recent Fixes
1. AtomicManager
   - Added execute_operation method
   - Fixed batch operation handling
   - Added proper error handling
   - Added more granular tests

2. ChangeDetector
   - Fixed operation type detection
   - Now correctly identifies UPDATE operations
   - Now correctly identifies DELETE operations
   - Added proper timestamp comparison

3. SyncEngineV2
   - Fixed PostHandler initialization
   - Now passes config to all handlers
   - Fixed component initialization order

## Next Steps
1. Fix path handling
   - Review and fix media path handling
   - Review and fix post path handling
   - Add tests for edge cases
   - Document path handling rules

2. Fix performance issues
   - Review sync performance test
   - Fix count mismatch
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Document performance requirements

3. Improve code organization
   - Consider splitting large files into modules
   - Add interface documentation
   - Improve error messages
   - Add type hints

## Important Lessons
1. Code Modification
   - Make small, targeted changes instead of broad sweeps
   - Always read and understand existing code before modifying
   - Test each change individually
   - Document why changes are needed

2. Refactoring Strategy
   - Break large files into logical modules
   - Keep functions focused and atomic
   - Add clear interface documentation
   - Maintain proper references between modules
   - Add comments explaining module relationships

3. Testing Approach
   - Write tests before fixing bugs
   - Add edge cases to test suite
   - Document test scenarios
   - Keep test files organized and focused
