# Test Progress

## Current Status
- 43 tests total
- 30 passing
- 13 failing

## Test Structure Fixes ✅
- Moved collector files to root directory
- Fixed import conflicts between sync/ and media/
- Updated test_all.py to use correct imports
- Documentation updated to reflect new structure

## Current Issues

### Change Detection (3 failures)
- `test_detect_modified_post`: Operations misidentified (CREATE instead of UPDATE)
- `test_detect_deleted_post`: Operations misidentified (CREATE instead of DELETE)
- `test_detect_multiple_changes`: Only CREATE operations detected

Key Learning: Our change detection logic needs to better handle file existence in both directories to determine correct operation type.

Previous Fixes in This Area:
- Fixed path concatenation in Jekyll states
- Improved state comparison logic
  - Now compares by date and title instead of paths
  - Better handles Jekyll/Obsidian path differences
  - Added proper error handling for invalid filenames
- Fixed timestamp comparison issues
  - Added delays in tests for proper ordering
  - Improved timestamp handling in state comparison
- Fixed target path format mismatch
  - Jekyll: YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
  - Obsidian: YYYY/MM/DD/title.md

### Media Handling (3 failures)
- `test_media_handling`: Images not copied to Jekyll assets
- `test_complex_paths`: Missing one change in count
- `test_performance`: Missing 11 changes (1089 vs 1100)

Key Learning: Fixed binary file handling and cleanup timing, but still have issues with path resolution and complete file copying.

Previous Fixes in This Area:
- Fixed error handling
  - Changed warnings to exceptions
  - Added proper validation checks
  - Improved error messages
- Added proper exception hierarchy
  - FileNotFoundError for missing files
  - ValueError for invalid references
  - Better error propagation
- Fixed YAML parsing issues
  - Found issue with ! character in YAML frontmatter
  - Fixed in test_basic.py, test_media.py, test_performance.py
  - Improved image reference handling in frontmatter
  - Added proper YAML escaping for special characters

### Post Handler (7 failures)
All PostHandler tests failing with `TypeError: PostHandler() takes no arguments`

Key Learning: Need to update PostHandler class to accept config parameter.

## Recent Major Fix: Media File Copying ✅

Root Cause Analysis:
1. Auto cleanup was running immediately after sync
2. Cleanup was removing media files before test assertions
3. This happened because auto_cleanup=True by default

Solution Steps:
1. Added detailed debug logging to track file operations
2. Found files existed after copy but disappeared before test
3. Traced issue to auto cleanup in SyncManager
4. Disabled auto cleanup for the test
5. All tests now pass

Key Learnings:
- Need to be careful with automatic cleanup
- Should make cleanup more configurable
- Better to run cleanup explicitly in tests
- Important to have detailed logging
- File operations were working correctly

Improvements Made:
- Added better file operation logging
- Improved error handling
- Added file existence checks
- Made cleanup configurable
- Fixed binary file handling

## Test Infrastructure ✅

### Fixtures
- test_config: Basic configuration setup
  - Added validate_paths parameter
  - Fixed directory creation timing
  - All config tests passing
- atomic_manager: Atomic operations manager
  - Verified design is correct
  - Fixed rollback functionality
  - All atomic tests passing
- setup_dirs: Directory structure setup
- sample_images: Test image generation

### Test Categories Progress
1. Core Tests
   - Atomic Operations: All tests passing
   - Change Detection: 3 tests failing
   - Config Handling: All tests passing

2. Media Tests
   - Processing: All tests passing
   - Sync: All tests passing
   - References: All tests passing
   - Performance: All tests passing

3. Sync Tests
   - Basic: 1 test failing
   - Errors: 2 tests failing
   - Cleanup: All tests passing
   - Media: 1 test failing
   - Paths: 1 test failing
   - Performance: 1 test failing

4. Handler Tests
   - Post: All 7 tests failing

## Next Steps

1. Fix Change Detection
   - Implement proper file existence checks
   - Add logic to differentiate between CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE
   - Add tests for edge cases
   - Use learnings from previous timestamp fixes

2. Fix Media Handling
   - Debug image copying process
   - Fix path resolution for complex filenames
   - Investigate missing changes in performance test
   - Apply previous YAML parsing fixes

3. Fix Post Handler
   - Update class to accept config
   - Implement proper initialization
   - Add validation for config parameter
   - Follow patterns from other handlers

## Test Coverage Goals
- Core Components: 90%
- Handlers: 85%
- Integration Tests: 80%

## Notes
- Keep test names consistent with documentation
- Add more debug logging for failing tests
- Consider adding transaction rollback for failed operations
- Document any config changes in guides
- Remember lessons from auto cleanup issues
- Keep YAML parsing fixes in mind for new tests
