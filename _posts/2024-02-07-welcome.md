# Welcome to My Blog!

Hi! I'm Teddy, and this is my new blog where I'll be sharing my thoughts and experiences about technology, AI, and open-source development.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:
- AI and Machine Learning
- Software Development
- Open Source Projects
- Tech Tips and Tutorials

## Test Section

This is a test section to trigger our CI and see what issues we might have with the build process. 
It will help us identify and fix any problems with:

1. HTML validation
2. Markdown linting
3. Link checking
4. Jekyll configuration

Stay tuned for more content!
