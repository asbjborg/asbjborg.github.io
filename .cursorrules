# Feature Development Workflow

## Prerequisites

1. Feature Creation
   - Create GitHub issue for the feature
   - Note the issue number (e.g., #6)
   - Add appropriate labels and milestone

2. Branch Setup
   - Create feature branch: `feature/name-v2`
   - Create feature.md from template
   - Create draft blog post in _drafts/
   - Add feature.md to .gitignore

## Order of Operations

1. Code Development
   - Write/update code in appropriate module
   - Follow modular structure
   - Add comments and docstrings
   - Consider error handling

2. Blog Post Update
   - Update draft post with new features
   - Add code examples if relevant
   - Keep tone casual but informative
   - Add technical details after the friendly intro

3. Feature Tracking
   - Update feature.md locally
   - Mark completed tasks
   - Add new tasks if discovered
   - Update progress details

4. Remote Feature Update
   - Use feature.md to update GitHub issue
   - Command: gh issue edit ISSUE_NUMBER --body "$(cat feature.md)"
   - DO NOT commit feature.md (should be in .gitignore)

5. Code Commits
   - Commit code changes
   - Commit blog post updates
   - Use descriptive commit messages
   - Push to feature branch

## File Structure

```chart
your-project/
├── .gitignore           # Should include feature.md
├── feature.md           # Local tracking, not committed
├── .cursorrules         # Development workflow rules
├── docs/
│   └── test-progress.yaml  # Test progress tracking
├── _drafts/
│   └── feature-name.md  # Draft blog post about feature
└── scripts/
    └── feature/         # Feature-specific code
```

## File Purposes

- feature.md: Local tracking only, used to update GitHub issue
- docs/test-progress.yaml: Development test tracking, should be committed
- _drafts/*.md: Blog post drafts, should be committed
- scripts/feature/: Feature-specific code, should be committed
- .cursorrules: Development workflow rules, should be committed

## Templates

### feature.md Template

```markdown
# Feature Name

Brief description of the feature.

## Tasks
1. Core Development
   - [ ] Task 1
   - [ ] Task 2

2. Documentation
   - [ ] Update technical docs
   - [ ] Write blog post
   - [ ] Add user guide

## Success Criteria
- Criterion 1
- Criterion 2

## Testing Scope
1. Unit Tests
   - Test area 1
   - Test area 2

Related branch: feature/name-v2
```

## Commit Message Style

- feat: New features
- fix: Bug fixes
- docs: Documentation updates
- refactor: Code restructuring
- test: Adding tests
- chore: Maintenance tasks

## Branch Strategy

- Create feature-specific branch
- Commit atomic changes
- Keep blog post updated with progress
- Update GitHub issue after significant changes
- PR when feature is complete

## Important Lessons

1. Code Modification
   - Make small, targeted changes instead of broad sweeps
   - Always read and understand existing code before modifying
   - Test each change individually
   - Document why changes are needed

2. Refactoring Strategy
   - Break large files into logical modules
   - Keep functions focused and atomic
   - Add clear interface documentation
   - Maintain proper references between modules
   - Add comments explaining module relationships

3. Testing Approach
   - Write tests before fixing bugs
   - Add edge cases to test suite
   - Document test scenarios
   - Keep test files organized and focused
